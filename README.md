**`WARNINGS:`
EPILEPSY WARNING! This game contains a LOT of flashing lights and colors.** 

`ABOUT: `
This is a rhythm game created for a game jam I hosted on my discord server. 
To play, you follow a glowing energy ball with your cursor, and while your cursor 
is on it, you earn score points. However, if your cursor isn't over the ball, 
you don't earn points! 
(When the songs get fast it get pretty hard!)

Currently with only two songs, B̶e̷a̵t̶ ̸M̷a̶l̸f̴u̴n̴c̷t̸i̷o̴n̸!
will probably get an update in the future!

Your score will be saved even if you quit the game mid song,
so finish the song to get max score!
Keep in mind that the song's length DOES change,
and you don't know what song you're playing until you click!
